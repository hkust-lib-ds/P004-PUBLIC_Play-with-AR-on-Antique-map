## AR tool used
We used the opensource web augmented reality library [MindAR](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/) to create the AR functions in our website.
+ Used [Image Tracking function](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/quick-start/overview) for [this page](https://library.hkust.edu.hk/ds/project/p004/map/AR.html)
    + In our case, we compiled our ancient map as targe images using [MindAR's Image Targets Compiler](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile/), and saved the compiled `.mind` files in `/data/mindTarget`
    + For the data, we input in json files under `/data/AR`
    + The data are then fetched to `AR.html`, `AR_Africa.html`, `AR_Asia.html`, `AR_Europe.html` via `/js/script_AR.js`
+ Used [Face Tracking function](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/face-tracking-quick-start/overview) for [this page](https://library.hkust.edu.hk/ds/project/p004/map/FaceDeco.html)
    + data: `/data/FaceDecoration/FaceDecoration_meta.json`
    + js: `/js/scripts_FaceDecoration.js`
    + page: `FaceDeco.html`
